two papular build tools in java ecosystem
1. Maven
2. Gradle

Gradle
Goal : Build, automate and deliver better software faster
	Build anything: Cross-platform tool
		java, c/c++, java, python
	Automate everything : completely programmable
		Completely flexbible 
			use Domain specific language like Groovy and Kotlin
	deliver faster : blazing-fast builds
	same project layout as Maven
			

add denependcy in build.gradle then right click on project > Gradle > refresh gradle 
to download the dependency 
same to remove the dependency

Gradle plugins
1. Java : Java compilation + testing + bundling capabilities
		key task : build
building a project build
right click on project > run as > run configuration > Gradle Task right click > new configuratin (rename configuration) > add > change task to build or anything
> choose workspace > apply > run
build folder : stores all the artifacts (files or directories that a project provides to the outside world) which are generated

2. Dependency management : Maven-like dependency management
implementation group : 'org.springframework', name : 'spring-core' version: '10.0.3.0.RELEASE'
or 
implementation : 'org.springframework:spring-core:10.0.3.0.RELEASE'
no need to manage version if it is managed gradle plugin

3. Spring boot gradle plugin : spring boot support in Gradle


creating tasks in gradle, gradle supports java as well
tasks.register('helloWorld'){
	doLast{
		System.out.println("Hello world");
	}
}
right click on project > run as > run configuration > Gradle Task right click > new configuratin (rename helloWorld) > add > change task to helloWorld
> choose workspace > apply > run

which one to use Maven vs Gradle
Let's start with a few popular examples:
	Spring Framework - Using Gradle since 2012 (Spring Framework v3.2.0)
	Spring Boot - Using Gradle since 2020 (Spring Boot v2.3.0) 
	Spring Cloud - Continues to use Maven even today
		Last update: Spring Cloud has no plans to switch
		
Top Maven Advantages: Familiar, Simple and Restrictive
Top Gradle Advantages: Faster build times and less verbose 

What Do I Recommend: I'm sitting on the fence for now
Choose whatever tool best meets your projects needs 
If your builds are taking really long, go with Gradle
If your builds are simple, stick with Maven
